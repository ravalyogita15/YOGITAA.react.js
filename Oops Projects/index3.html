    <!-- EXPLANATION

INPUT :

Vehicle Class:
- The Vehicle class is defined with a constructor that takes two parameters: make and model.
- Inside the constructor, the make and model properties of the instance are set to the values passed to the
constructor.
- It also has a method getInfo() that returns a string containing the make and model of the vehicle.

Car Class:
- The Car class is a subclass of Vehicle. It inherits all the properties and methods of the Vehicle class. 
- The Car class also has a constructor that takes three parameters: make, model, and year.
- Inside the constructor, the super() method is called to call the constructor of the parent class (Vehicle)
with the make and model parameters.
- The year property is then set to the value passed to the constructor.
- The getInfo() method overrides the getInfo() method of the parent class. It returns a string containing the 
maken and model of the vehicle, as well as the year.

- The myCar variable is initialized with a new Car object with the make, model, and year parameters.
- The getInfo() method of the myCar object is called, which returns a string containing the make, model, and year of the car.


OUTPUT : Make: Toyota, Model: Camry, Year: 2
