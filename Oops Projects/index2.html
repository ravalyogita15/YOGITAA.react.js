    <!-- EXPLANATION

INPUT :

- The super keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class. It is used to access the properties and methods of the parent class. 
- Here, The super keyword is used to call the constructor of the Shape class and initialize the color property
- Then the super keyword is used to call the constructor of the Circle class and initialize the color and radius properties
- Then the super keyword is used to call the constructor of the ColoredCircle class and initialize the color, radius, and color properties
- The getColor() method is used to return the value of the color property.
- The coloredCircle variable is initialized with a new instance of the ColoredCircle class, which is a child class of the
- Circle class and a child class of the Shape class. The color property is initialized with the value 'blue' and the radius
  property is initialized with the value 5.
- The getColor() method is called on the coloredCircle object, which returns the value of the color property, which is 'blue'.


OUTPUT : blue
    
-->
