<!-- EXPLANATION

 INPUT :

 -  The Animal class has a constructor that takes a name parameter and assigns it to the instance property 
  this.name.
 -  It also has a method speak() which simply logs a message saying that the animal makes a noise, using 
  the name property.
 - The Dog class overrides the speak() method of the Animal class. 
 - Then creates a new instance of the Dog class with the name 'Buddy'.
 - Since Dog extends Animal, it automatically calls the constructor of Animal to initialize the name property.
 - Since Dog has its own speak() method, this method is called instead of the one defined in Animal.
 - As a result, the message "Buddy barks." is logged to the console.


 OUTPUT : Buddy barks.
